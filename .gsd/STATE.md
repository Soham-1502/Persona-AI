## Current Position
- **Phase**: 4
- **Task**: Execution
- **Status**: COMPLETE.

## Last Session Summary
Finished Phase 4 logic. Successfully bridged the frontend `ConfidenceCoachUI` analytic variables to the backend `POST /api/confidence-coach/session` endpoint, storing them against the User's MongoDB document. Successfully aggregated those stored counts onto the global `/dashboard` Insights chip array.

## Next Steps
1. Reconcile trackers globally (`ROADMAP.md`).
2. Transition project back to User to audit module and call `/complete-milestone`.
