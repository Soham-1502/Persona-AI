# Plan 1.1 Summary

- Created `app/confidence-coach/page.jsx` integrating the shared Header component.
- Created `app/components/confidence-coach/ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` layout split between video and instructions.
- Implemented `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` to hook camera stream to a `<video>` element.
- Added scenario selection dropdown.
- Integrated `SpeechRecognition` to detect "Start" and "END This Speech" voice commands.
- Configured continuous speech recognition to accumulate transcript into state.
- Automatically generate a `sessionId` UUID and record `startTime` timestamp when starting.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
All components are bundled and compiled smoothly, adhering to Next.js Client Component standard. We successfully built a video footprint and speech engine ready to layer ML tracking models in the next plans.
