# Execution Summary: Phase 3, Plan 3.2

## What Was Computed
- Added a `difficulty` parameter ("Beginner", "Intermediate", "Expert") to the `app/components/confidence-coach/ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` state.
- Passed `difficulty` within the JSON body of the `generate-questions` payload.
- Rewrote `app/api/confidence-coach/generate-questions/route.js` to parse this difficulty string into systemic modifiers injected directly into the Gemini prompt (e.g., instructing Gemini to generate "aggressive/hostile" scenarios for Expert).

## ConfidenceCoachUI Changes
- Inserted a standard `<select>` dropdown parallel to the Scenario Category dropdown for Difficulty.
- Modified the holistic scoring foundation in `endSession()`: Beginners start at a baseline of `5.0`. Intermediates start at `3.0`. Experts start at `1.0`, requiring statistically flawless posture, audio normalization, and emotional positivity to score above an 8.0/10.

## Validated
ESLint compilation passes, and the state dynamically re-renders.
