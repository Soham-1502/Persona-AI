# Phase 3, Plan 3.2: Difficulty Level Adaptation

## Objective
Adapt the `Score` multiplier and the `Scenario` questions based on a user-selected "Difficulty Level".

## Context
Currently, the `finalScore` is a hardcapped linear equation that maxes at 10.0 equally for everyone. Additionally, the Gemini AI prompt is generic. By introducing "Beginner", "Intermediate", and "Expert" difficulties, we can customize the Strictness of the grading and the complexity of the AI Scenario prompts.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Update `route.js` Prompt**: Modify `app/api/confidence-coach/generate-questions/route.js` to accept a `difficulty` parameter.
    - If `Beginner`, prompt for a simple, straight-forward question.
    - If `Expert`, prompt for a hostile, tricky, or aggressive scenario variation.
2. **UI Difficulty State**: In `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx`:
    - Add a `const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState("Beginner");` state.
    - Render a toggle or select box above the Scenario Category.
    - Pass this `difficulty` alongside `scenarioCategory` into the `/api/confidence-coach/generate-questions` payload.
3. **Adaptive Scoring Engine**: Inside the `endSession()` aggregate score block:
    - `Beginner`: Default grading (current logic). Base Score 5.0. No penalties for silence or "neutral" face. 
    - `Intermediate`: Base score 3.0. -0.5 penalty if face visibility is under 50%.
    - `Expert`: Base score 1.0. Math requires near-perfect blendshape positivity and volume stability to reach 10.0.

## Validation
Verify the LLM returns noticeably distinct question difficulties before moving the `ConfidenceCoachUI` score variables.
