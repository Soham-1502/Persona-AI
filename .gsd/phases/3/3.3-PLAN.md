# Phase 3, Plan 3.3: Post-Session Analytics Display

## Objective
Transform the `ended` state in the `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` to render a detailed, componentized breakdown of the user's performance instead of a single digit out of 10.

## Context
Currently, when a session ends, the user only sees "Holistic Confidence Score: 8.5/10". To truly act as a "Coach", the UI must provide actionable feedback derived from the `mlStats` array.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Build `MetricsBreakdown` Sub-Component**: Inside `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` (or a fresh file if it gets too large), create a UI block that renders precisely what went wrong/right.
    - **Pacing**: Use the `audioMetrics.volumeVariance` to say "Your voice was shaky" or "Your voice was steady".
    - **Posture**: "You stood straight for 100% of the session." or "You were slouching/unknown for X%."
    - **Emotion**: Display the count of `positiveFrames` vs `tenseFrames`.
    - **Eye Contact**: Show `visibleFaceFrames` ratio as "Eye Contact & Frame Presence".
2. **Integration**: Unmount the simple Score string in the `sessionStatus === "ended"` view, and replace it with a cleanly-styled Tailwind grid displaying these 4 metrics alongside the Holistic Score.

## Validation
Visually test the `/confidence-coach` page. The "Processing Analysis..." loader should naturally fade into this comprehensive grid after pressing the Bumblebee end keyword.
