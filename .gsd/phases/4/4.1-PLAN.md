# Execution Plan: Phase 4, Plan 4.1 (Database Schema Update)

## Objective
Verify and update the `User` mongoose model to ensure it can gracefully accept metrics dispatched by the Confidence Coach module.

## Context
Looking at `models/User.js`, there is already a `confidenceCoachStats` block:
```javascript
  confidenceCoachStats: {
    sessionsCompleted: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    voiceTrainingMinutes: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    lastSessionDate: { type: Date, default: null },
    averageScore: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  },
```

## Execution Steps
1. Review `models/User.js` to ensure the structure meets our requirements.
2. If we want to track specific heuristics (e.g. `averageEyeContact` or `averagePosture`), append them to this schema block.
3. Otherwise, the existing schema is sufficient to track the primary metrics (score, time, instances). Mark as verified.
