# Execution Plan: Phase 4, Plan 4.4 (Dashboard Integration)

## Objective
Reflect the `confidenceCoachStats` stored inside MongoDB on the user's main `InsightsCard.jsx` and Dashboard views.

## Context
Currently, the `InsightsCard` attempts to render dynamic `pattern`, `snapshot`, and `suggestion` heuristics based on user history.

## Execution Steps
1. Trace where `insights` is formulated on the backend (usually `app/api/user/insights/route.js` or `app/api/dashboard/route.js`).
2. Update the logic that generates the `snapshot` chips. If `user.confidenceCoachStats.sessionsCompleted > 0`, append a chip reflecting their Coach usage (e.g., `'Public Speaking: Active'`).
3. Potentially update the `suggestion` block to recommend the Confidence Coach if `sessionsCompleted` is 0.
4. Verify the `InsightsCard` natively displays the new JSON properties.
