# Execution Summary: Phase 4, Plan 4.3

## What Was Computed
- Connected `app/components/confidence-coach/ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` to the `POST /api/confidence-coach/session` endpoint.
- Integrated the `fetch` block squarely at the bottom of the `endSession` callback, acting as a background "fire and forget" update that doesn't block the UI rendering of the Analytics Dashboard.
- Stripped the temporary/mocked `getAuthToken()` dependency, as NextAuth seamlessly authenticates the `/api/` bridge via secure cookie streams.

## Validated
The `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` module compiles under ESLint warnings (unrelated dependency array flags only). Tests simulating session conclusions transmit cleanly to the backend route without breaking the React hook lifecycle.
