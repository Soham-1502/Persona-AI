# Plan 2.2 Summary

- Upgraded `app/components/confidence-coach/MediaPipeAnalyzer.js` to process `evaluateOpenness`.
- Isolated landmarks for Shoulders (11, 12) and Wrists (15, 16).
- Mapped visible wrist distance-to-shoulder width ratio seamlessly onto an `open | closed | neutral` enumeration.
- Fed pipeline results seamlessly back into React `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` via `onResults`.
- Lowered base Confidence Score slightly to reallocate scoring allowance, integrating the `openFrames` volume directly into the 0.0-10.0 scaler logic transparently.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
The pipeline parses frames without dividing by zero on edge case angles effectively. ESLint passes with stable output rules.
