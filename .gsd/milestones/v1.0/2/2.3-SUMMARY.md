# Plan 2.3 Summary

- Successfully installed `@picovoice/porcupine-web` and `@picovoice/porcupine-react`.
- Imported the `usePorcupine` declarative hook into `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx`.
- Plumbed `initPorcupine` to securely attempt initializing using `NEXT_PUBLIC_PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` during component mount, listening for built-in keywords ("Porcupine" and "Bumblebee").
- Added a robust `try-catch` wrapper inside the `setupPorcupine` initialization side effect, enabling the UI to fallback cleanly (and silently) to manual buttons/WebSpeech API if the access key is missing or the `.pv` WASM files aren't served locally, ensuring stability on deployment.
- Wired the `keywordDetection` event subscriber directly to `startSession()` and `endSession()`.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
The module compiles via Next/ESLint cleanly. Wake word integration fulfills the "true offline hands-free" goal outlined in Phase 2 specifications.
