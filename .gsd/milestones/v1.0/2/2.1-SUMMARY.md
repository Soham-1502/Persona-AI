# Plan 2.1 Summary

- Created `app/api/confidence-coach/generate-questions/route.js`.
- Implemented `@google/genai` to generate a single, specific realistic string scenario question dynamically.
- Refactored `app/components/confidence-coach/ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` to accommodate `scenarioCategory` vs `question` structure.
- Wired a simple `fetch` request linked to the dropdown change handler (`useEffect`).
- Provided fallback states and `Loader2` spinning indicators while the AI request processes.
- The correct `question` string is seamlessly integrated into the payload passed down to `endSession` for the API route.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
ESLint validated. The AI safely responds via flash model limits and gracefully populates the ConfidenceCoach context.
