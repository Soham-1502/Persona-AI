# Plan 1.3 Summary

- Created `app/components/confidence-coach/AudioAnalyzer.js` to hook into Web Audio API (`AudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`).
- Processed live microphone frequency data to compute average volume and volume variance dynamically over the session.
- Integrated `AudioAnalyzer` and `MediaPipeAnalyzer` smoothly into `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx`.
- Handled the "End Speech" session transition securely, cleaning up all MediaStream tracks and `AnalyserNodes`.
- Aggregated Face visibility (2.5 pts), Posture openness (1.5 pts), and Volume stability (1.0 pt), alongside a base score to compute a final 0.0-10.0 score.
- Assembled the full required API payload (`sessionId`, `gameType`, `question`, `userAnswer`, `score`, `timeTaken`) into React state, preparing for the Plan 1.4 API persistence integration.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
All audio context processing is correct and free of memory leaks. The UI now gracefully computes tracking metrics securely on the client and transitions smoothly to the result screen.
