# Plan 1.2 Summary

- Installed `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` module for face and pose landmarking.
- Created `app/components/confidence-coach/MediaPipeAnalyzer.js` module.
- Implemented `initMediaPipeModels` to securely fetch and load `FaceLandmarker` and `PoseLandmarker`.
- Created a custom heuristic `determinePosture` comparing Y-coordinates and visibility of hips vs knees to calculate whether the user is standing or sitting.
- Implemented `startMediaPipeStream` requestAnimationFrame loop that safely checks for video frame updates to supply data out to the main UI component via an `onResults` callback.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
Dependency added securely. Component lints successfully and exports standard, reusable modules for WebAssembly ML processing. Ready to hook into the video footprint from Plan 1.1.
