# Plan 1.4 Summary

- Explored global `UserAttempt` and `User` schema definitions.
- Created `app/api/confidence-coach/session/route.js` endpoint to handle the `POST` request.
- Secured the route with `import { authenticate } from '@/lib/auth'`.
- Inserted standard database connection mechanisms (`connectDB()`).
- Added robust data parsing mapping the Confidence Coach final payload context directly into scalable `UserAttempt` records.
- Incremental state update to `user.confidenceCoachStats` processing metrics cleanly.
- Implemented `import { getAuthToken } from "@/lib/auth-client"` and a `fetch` wrapper inside `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` that fires asynchronously without blocking the results screen in UI.

**Verification Status**: ✅ Passing
The backend effectively receives the multi-modal payload and updates global metrics safely. The UI initiates network request with proper JWT token passing gracefully.
