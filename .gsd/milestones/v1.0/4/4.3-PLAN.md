# Execution Plan: Phase 4, Plan 4.3 (UI Persistence Hook)

## Objective
Bind the `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` React component to the newly created `POST` API route to push the data asynchronously upon session conclusion.

## Context
Inside the `endSession` callback, we currently process the raw variables into an object called `payload`. That object just sits in React state. We need it written back to the database.

## Execution Steps
1. Locate the `endSession()` logic block inside `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx`.
2. Immediately after formatting the `payload` and dispatching `setFinalDataPayload`, execute a `fetch` request against `/api/confidence-coach/session`.
3. Pass the `score` and `timeTaken` attributes inside the JSON body.
4. Add basic `try/catch` error handling to cleanly resolve the API network promise in the background.
