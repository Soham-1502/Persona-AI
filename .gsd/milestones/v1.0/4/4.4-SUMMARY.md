# Execution Summary: Phase 4, Plan 4.4

## What Was Computed
- Examined the backend aggregation pipeline at `app/api/dashboard/insights/route.js`.
- Modified the Snapshot generator inside `generateInsights()`. If a user successfully completed a Confidence Coach session at least once (`user.confidenceCoachStats.sessionsCompleted > 0`), the backend injects a string chip: `Public Speaker • [N] sessions`.
- The `InsightsCard` component naturally receives and renders this payload natively.

## Validated
ESLint compiled cleanly. As the system parses nested properties like `confidenceCoachStats?.sessionsCompleted`, no crashes will occur for legacy users accessing the `/dashboard` route before engaging with the Confidence Coach module.
