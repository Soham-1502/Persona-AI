# Execution Summary: Phase 4, Plan 4.1

## What Was Computed
- Reviewed the MongoDB `userSchema` configuration inside `models/User.js`.
- Verified that the system successfully tracks the overarching variables dictated by Phase 4.

## Validated
No modifications were necessary, meaning the database layer will not force migration headaches on existing accounts. `confidenceCoachStats` schema remains: `sessionsCompleted`, `voiceTrainingMinutes`, `lastSessionDate`, and `averageScore`.
