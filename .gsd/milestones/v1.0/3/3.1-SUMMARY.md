# Execution Summary: Phase 3, Plan 3.1

## What Was Computed
- Added heuristic `evaluateEmotion(faceBlendshapes)` into `MediaPipeAnalyzer.js`.
- It dynamically maps MediaPipe's ARKit blendshapes (`mouthSmileLeft`, `browDownLeft`) to emotional states: `positive`, `tense`, or `neutral`.

## ConfidenceCoachUI Changes
- Appended `positiveFrames`, `tenseFrames`, and `emotionMeasuredFrames` counters into the `mlStats` React state.
- Updated the `endSession()` holistic score math. The base score was reduced by 0.5 points to make room for Emotion. Positive expressions reward up to `+1.0` points, while tension negatively penalizes up to `-1.0` points.

## Validated
The lint compilation passes and the integration successfully relies safely on structural integrity tests before parsing `faceResult.faceBlendshapes`.
