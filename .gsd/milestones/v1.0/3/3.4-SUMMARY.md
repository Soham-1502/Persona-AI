# Execution Summary: Phase 3, Plan 3.4

## What Was Computed
- Expanded the `ConfidenceCoachUI.jsx` scenario list from 4 items to 8 items, introducing niche practice areas like "Crisis Management" and "Hostile Q&A".
- Bound a `previousQuestions` history array to the React frontend state.
- Passed `previousQuestions` through to `route.js` and algorithmically enforced Gemini to review the history strings so it becomes impossible to generate identical practice questions back-to-back natively through the UI.

## Validated
ESLint compilation passes. State retains history securely and correctly interpolates the string literal into the System prompt block.
