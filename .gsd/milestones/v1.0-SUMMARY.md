# Milestone: v1.0 (Confidence Coach Module)

## Completed: 2026-02-21

## Deliverables
- ✅ Real-time browser-based multi-modal analysis (face, voice, body)
- ✅ Hands-free voice commands ("Start", "END This Speech")
- ✅ Backend integration for persisting session stats
- ✅ Dashboard integration for displaying progress

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 1: MVP - Core Multi-modal Analysis & Voice Commands — Completed
2. Phase 2: Enhanced - Auto-detection & AI Questions — Completed
3. Phase 3: Advanced - Analytics & Adaptation — Completed
4. Phase 4: Backend API & Dashboard Integration — Completed

## Metrics
- Features: Real-time Audio Context stream, MediaPipe Body Segmentation, Wake Word AI, Emotion tracking, and dynamic NextJs Full Stack persistence.
- Duration: 1 Day

## Lessons Learned
- Web Audio API integration with React state hooks requires meticulous cleanup via `abort()` buffers to prevent lingering transcript pieces when navigating around UI components.
- Relying on device orientation for simple checks inside MediaPipe can safely be extrapolated onto heuristic buckets (e.g. tracking visible face landmarks + hip joints over elapsed frames).
